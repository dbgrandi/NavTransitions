# Interactive Navigation Transitions in Swift

This was fun, and I learned a few things that I found quite interesting. You can read about it on [my blog](https://dbgrandi.github.io/playing_with_interactive_nav_transitions/). Tap the first view controller to push another one onto the navigation stack.

Note: This requires at least Xcode Beta 4, and possibly ONLY Beta 4.
